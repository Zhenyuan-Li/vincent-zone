# Vincent's Zone

A naive technique blog for recording my learning process. Also keep track of events held by me and my buddies. Currently is public and deployed, but still in polish and further developing process.

## Main Sections & Features

### Post

- All the valuable resources nicely arranged and displayed. Normally, they are the follow along notes I took through out the learning process. Comments are welcome~
- The default markdown file are located in content folder. They are nicely rendered on the web through packages: [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) & [react-syntax-highlighter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-syntax-highlighter)
- Three notes only, will keep adding...(20+ notes are finished, but need time to be perfect)

### Event

- Working experience sharing, new tech stack communication, casual chatting... Just a place to keep track of future meeting & record memorable events.

### Contact & About Me

- Where you could talk with me directly. The data are stored in MongoDB Atlas.
- 'About Me' Supposed to be a link to my portfolio. But is pulled down due to bug.

## Tech stack

Next.js, React, MongoDB, React-markdown...

## TODO Lists:

1. Unified Code style
2. Refactor http request using custom hooks
3. Consistency Comments Component
4. T.B.C: add an express server to fetch the data dynamically

## Background & Vincent's Advice

- This project was initially inspired and guided by [Maximilian Schwarzmüller's](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) Nextjs course (see below). Most of the UI design follows Max's original edition.

- I am definitely a fan of Max, really like his teaching style and detailed explanation. Here are some his courses that I recommended. (All of them I have enrolled and finished.)

  1. [Vue - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)
  2. [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)
  3. [Next.js & React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/)
  4. [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/)
  5. [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) (actually half finished...)
  6. [Understanding TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/learn/lecture/16999308?start=15#overview)

     Again, Danke schön, Max!
